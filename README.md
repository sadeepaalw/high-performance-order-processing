# High-Performance Order Processing System

A scalable, memory-efficient order processing system that handles high-volume concurrent requests with optimal resource utilization.

## System Requirements

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 13 or higher
- Redis 6 or higher

## Performance Targets

- Concurrent Requests: 10,000+ simultaneous requests
- Response Time: Sub-200ms average response time
- Throughput: 5000+ requests per second
- Memory Constraint: 512MB heap memory
- Availability: 99.9% uptime under load

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd order-processing
```

2. Build the application:
```bash
mvn clean package
```

3. Start the required services using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
java -jar target/order-processing-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## API Endpoints

### Order Processing Service
- POST /api/orders/batch - Process batch orders (up to 1000 orders)
- GET /api/orders/{id} - Retrieve order with caching
- PUT /api/orders/{id}/status - Update order status
- GET /api/orders/stream - Real-time order updates
- POST /api/orders/stress-test - Load testing endpoint

### System Monitoring Service
- GET /api/system/memory - Memory usage statistics
- GET /api/system/performance - Performance metrics
- GET /api/system/health - System health check

### Analytics Service
- GET /api/analytics/throughput - Throughput metrics
- GET /api/analytics/latency - Latency statistics
- GET /api/analytics/bottlenecks - Performance analysis

## Performance Optimization Features

1. Memory Management
   - G1GC garbage collector configuration
   - Object pooling for frequently created objects
   - Efficient resource cleanup

2. Concurrency & Thread Safety
   - Async processing with CompletableFuture
   - Thread pool optimization
   - Lock-free data structures

3. Caching Strategy
   - Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - In-memory caching for hot data
   - Cache invalidation policies

4. Database Optimization
   - Connection pooling
   - Batch processing
   - Index optimization

## Monitoring and Metrics

The application exposes various metrics through Spring Boot Actuator endpoints:
- /actuator/health
- /actuator/metrics
- /actuator/prometheus

## Load Testing

To run load tests:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/orders/stress-test?orderCount=10000"
```

## Docker Deployment

Build and run the Docker container:
```bash
docker build -t order-processing .
docker run -p 8080:8080 order-processing
```

## Resource Limits

The application is configured with the following resource limits:
- JVM Heap: 512MB maximum
- Thread Pool: 20-50 threads
- Connection Pool: 50 connections
- Redis Connection Pool: 8 connections
